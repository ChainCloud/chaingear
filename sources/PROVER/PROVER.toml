short_description = "We live in the world of rapidly evolving technology, which dictates new\nconsumption patterns and communication culture bringing faster, cheaper and\nmore convenient ways for people to interact with each other and get\nservices from vendors. On the other hand, this new environment leaves\nconcerning possibilities for exploiting these new forms of communication\nagainst its adopters threatening to undermine the trust between the members\nof the new digital society. New security solutions are required to address\nthese concerns and eliminate the risks of fraud and disinformation in the\nmarket.\nWe present PROVER â€“ an open source decentralized Blockchain platform for\nverification of authenticity of user generated video files. The purpose of\nPROVER is to eliminate forgery of video materials and confirm their\nauthenticity using video analysis algorithms and Blockchain."
